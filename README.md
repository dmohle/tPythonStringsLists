Starting repo for Python Strings and Lists Program

String Instructions: 
########################################
For this assignment, you will work with various string functions to manipulate and analyze text data. You are provided with a sample text string. Your task is to write Python code to perform the specified operations using string functions.

text = "Python is an amazing programming language. It is versatile, easy to learn, and powerful."

Length Calculation: Write a function calculate_length(text) that takes the given text as input and returns the length of the text (including spaces and punctuation).

Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the text in uppercase letters followed by the text in lowercase letters.

Word Count: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the total number of words in the text.

Substring Extraction: Write Python code that takes the given text, and returns the substring of text starting from the start index (inclusive) and ending at the end index (exclusive) supplied by a user.

Word Replacement: Write Python code that takes the given text, a target word (input by the user), and replacement word (input by the user) as input, and returns the text with all occurrences of the target word replaced by the replacement word.

Whitespace Removal: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the text with all leading and trailing whitespaces removed.

Splitting into Sentences: Write a function split_sentences(text) that takes the given text as input and returns a list of sentences present in the text.

Word Reversal: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the text with each word reversed.

Character Count: Write Python code that takes the given text and a character as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the specified character in the text.

Substring Count: Write Python code that takes the given text and a substring as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring in the text.

Note: You can assume that the input text does not contain any punctuation other than periods.

Feel free to modify the assignment based on the level of your students and any specific requirements you have for the assignment.

# Test your program code with the provided text:
text = "Python is an amazing programming language. It is versatile, easy to learn, and powerful."

List Instructions:
################################################
For this assignment, you will work with the provided string to create a list. You will then apply ten common list operations to manipulate and analyze the list data.

text = "Python is an amazing programming language. It is versatile, easy to learn, and powerful."

List Creation: Create a list called word_list by splitting the given text into words.

Appending: Append the word "Pythonic" to the word_list.

Insertion: Insert the word "awesome" at the beginning of the word_list.

Indexing and Slicing: Print the third word in the word_list and then print a sublist containing the words from the 6th to 9th position.

Removal: Remove the word "amazing" from the word_list.

Sorting: Sort the word_list in alphabetical order.

Counting: Count the occurrences of the word "is" in the word_list.

Joining: Create a string sentence by joining the words in the word_list with spaces.

Reversal: Reverse the order of elements in the word_list.

Copying: Create a new list copied_list by copying the contents of the word_list.

Test each operation thoroughly and print the results for verification.

Note: Pay attention to the difference between 0-based indexing in lists and the indexing/slicing provided in the assignment.

Feel free to modify the assignment based on the level of your students and any specific requirements you have for the assignment.
