# tPythonStringsLists
Starting repo for Python Strings and Lists Program

Instructions: 
For this assignment, you will work with various string functions to manipulate and analyze text data. You are provided with a sample text string. Your task is to write Python code to perform the specified operations using string functions.

text = "Python is an amazing programming language. It is versatile, easy to learn, and powerful."

Length Calculation: Write a function calculate_length(text) that takes the given text as input and returns the length of the text (including spaces and punctuation).

Uppercase and Lowercase Conversion: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the text in uppercase letters followed by the text in lowercase letters.

Word Count: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the total number of words in the text.

Substring Extraction: Write Python code that takes the given text, and returns the substring of text starting from the start index (inclusive) and ending at the end index (exclusive) supplied by a user.

Word Replacement: Write Python code that takes the given text, a target word (input by the user), and replacement word (input by the user) as input, and returns the text with all occurrences of the target word replaced by the replacement word.

Whitespace Removal: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the text with all leading and trailing whitespaces removed.

Splitting into Sentences: Write a function split_sentences(text) that takes the given text as input and returns a list of sentences present in the text.

Word Reversal: Write Python code that takes the given text as input and returns the text with each word reversed.

Character Count: Write Python code that takes the given text and a character as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the specified character in the text.

Substring Count: Write Python code that takes the given text and a substring as input, and returns the number of occurrences of the specified substring in the text.

Note: You can assume that the input text does not contain any punctuation other than periods.

Feel free to modify the assignment based on the level of your students and any specific requirements you have for the assignment.
